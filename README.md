Ultimate goal is to predict which season of the year (winter, spring, summer, or

Dataset used is a subset of the Open Power System Data, which contains various hourly power
related measurements (e.g., consumption, wind generation, solar capacity) across EU 
countries from 2015 to approximately 2020.
